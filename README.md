---

### Lock Screen

:bangbang: **Note that all gnome-shell extensions get disabled in the lock screen**.

Alarms, stopwatch and other timers won't work when the screen is locked.

---

### Sections

Each section (timer, stopwatch, alarms..) can open as a separate menu when it's
icon is clicked, or it can appear together with other sections in one menu.

Individual sections can be disabled.

Right-clicking on the panel icons will open a context section with
some useful links.

---

### Fullscreen Interface

This extension has a fullscreen interface, which can be used to control a
corresponding section as well as replace regular notifications.

The interface has multi-monitor support, and it can be opened _(and brought into
focus)_ via a keyboard shortcut.

When in fullscreen, some keyboard shortcuts are available:

<table>
    <th align="left" colspan="2">All</th>
    <tr>
        <td><kbd>Tab</kbd></td>
        <td>navigate forward</td>

### Todo.txt Manager

Some of the features of the todo.txt manager are:

* Fuzzy task searching.
* Filtering by context, project, priority, custom fuzzy filters...
* Toggling a filter on/off by clicking on a priority, context, or proj in a task.
* Support for multiple todo files and corresponding done files and csv dirs.
* Compound sorting by priority, due date, completion date, creation date, etc...
* Fuzzy autocompletion for contexts and projects when inline editing a task.
* Autoupdating when the todo.txt file changes.
* Deleting all completed tasks and optionally storing them into a done.txt file.
* Switching between different views via keyboard shortcuts.

The todo.txt manager also has support for urls and file paths:
```
(A) @asdf https://www.google.com
(A) @asdf www.google.com

(A) @asdf /home/user/Documents
(A) @asdf ~/Documents
(A) @asdf ~/Documents/img.png
(A) @asdf ~/Documents/file\ with\ spaces.png
```

Supported todo.txt extensions are:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>tracker_id:string</code></td>
        <td>
            This extension is used to identify a task when starting/stopping
            the time-tracker via the command-line.<br>
            Multiple tasks can have the same tracker_id.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>pri:A-Z</code></td>
        <td>

as<br>
            provide the ability to sort tasks by due date.

        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><code>rec:recurrence_string</code></td>
        <td>

            If a task is already open on the date of the recursion, it's
creation date will be updated anyway.</i><br><br>
            The <i>recurrence_string</i> can be in one of 3 diff forms:<br>
            <i>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;(n=natural number, d=days, w=weeks,
m=months)</i><br><br>
            <ol>
            <li>
            <code>rec:n(d|w)</code><br>
                This means that the task will recur n days/weeks after the
creation date.<br>
                <i>- This rec type requires a creation date.</i><br>
                Examples:<br>
                <ul>
                <li>
                <code>x 2000-01-01 2000-01-01 rec:12d</code> means that the task
will reopen<br>
every 12 days starting from <code>2000-01-01</code>. After 12 days it will
look like<br>
                <code>2000-01-13 rec:12d</code>, and 12 days after that it will
look like<br>
                <code>2000-01-25 rec:12d</code>, and so on...

            <li>
                <code>rec:x-n(d|w)</code><br>

completion date.<br>
                <i>- This rec type requires a completion date if the task is
complete.</i><br>
                Examples:<br>

                <li><code>x 2000-01-01 rec:x-12d</code> recurs 12 days after

                <li><code>(A) rec:x-3w</code> recurs 3 weeks after completion
date.</li>
                </ul>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <code>rec:nd-nm</code><br>
                This means that the task will recur on the n-th day of every
n-th month starting<br>
                from the month of creation.<br>
                <i>- This rec type requires a creation date.</i><br>
                <i>- Note that since when creating a task, one can set the
creation date to any arbitrary<br>
                date, 'month of creation' here refers to the month written into
the todo.txt file.<br>
                - If a month doesn't have the particular n-th day, the last day
of

                Examples:<br>
                <ul>
                <li><code>(A) 2000-01-01 rec:12d-1m</code> recurs on the 12th

### Time Tracker

The time tracker is built into the todo.txt manager and allows you to track the
time spent on a particular task as well as the time spent on a particular
project.  

> This extension features a fullscreen stats view for browsing your time-tracker data
> * The stats view has a cool looking vbars graph for displaying data
> * It supports viewing time spent on tasks/projects on any recorded day
> * You can see a detailed view for a particular task/project
> * You can fuzzy search your history
> * You can view the most worked on tasks/projects in a particular time interval

When pressing the play button to track a task, all projects associated with that
task will also be tracked.

At the start of each year, the current yearly csv file will be archived and a 
new file will be started.

There is also a daily csv file which gets appended to the yearly file at the 
start of each day.

> **NOTE:**  
> When editing a task that has been time-tracked, only the corresponding entry
in the daily csv file will be updated. The yearly csv file will not be changed.

The csv file has the form:

```csv
date, time spent (hh:mm), type ('++' = project, '()' = task), task or project

2017-02-04, 08:03, ++, "+my_project"
2017-02-04, 23:59, ++, "+protect_gotham"
2017-02-04, 02:03, ++, "+protect_gotham"
2017-02-04, 02:03, (), "(A) Watch the world burn."
2017-02-04, 02:03, (), "(A) Catch Joker."
2017-02-04, 02:03, (), "(Z) Take the trash out."
2017-02-05, 08:03, ++, "+my_project"
2017-02-05, 23:59, ++, "+protect_gotham"
2017-02-05, 02:03, ++, "+protect_gotham"
2017-02-05, 02:03, (), "(A) Watch the world burn."
2017-02-05, 02:03, (), "x 2017-02-05 Catch Joker."
2017-02-05, 02:03, (), "(Z) Take the trash out."
```

> **HINT:**  
> There is an option to pause the time tracker when the pomodoro stops!

### DBus API

This extension comes with a dbus api. Check out the [dbus dir](dbus) for info on
what you can do.

There are also some example scripts that might come in handy. :smile:

---

### Custom Theme Support

This extension supports custom themes. In order to style it, place a
`timepp.css` file into your theme's root directory _(the dir where the
`gnome-shell.css` file is)_.

You must use the `!important` directive in order to override a property from the
extensions' stylesheet.

---

### Pango Markup

The todo.txt manager, timer and alarm support
[pango markup](https://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/PangoMarkupFormat.html).


> **NOTE:**  
> The pango markup will appear in the `todo.txt` file as well if used in the 
todo.txt manager.  
> Notifications will only show the `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>` tags and links.
